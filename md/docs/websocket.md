# WebSocket

Real-time communication with WebSocket support. Built-in hub management, room-based messaging, and collaborative features.

## Overview

### Multi-Room Support

Organize users into rooms with automatic user list management and room-specific broadcasting.

### Real-time Messaging

Instant message delivery with system notifications and typing indicators.

### Collaborative Features

Cursor tracking, collaborative drawing, code editing, and shared whiteboards.

Base Framework includes a production-ready WebSocket implementation with automatic hub initialization, connection management, and message broadcasting. The system supports multiple rooms, user management, and various collaborative features out of the box.

**WebSocket Endpoint**

The WebSocket server runs automatically when you start Base Framework and is available at `/api/ws`
## Connecting to WebSocket

### Basic Connection

```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket server
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8100/api/ws?id=user123&nickname=John&room=general');

socket.onopen = function(event) {
    console.log('Connected to WebSocket server');
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('Received message:', message);
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket server');
};

socket.onerror = function(error) {
    console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
};
```

### Connection Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| id | Optional | Unique client identifier |
| nickname | Optional | Display name for the user |
| room | Optional | Room to join (default: general) |
## Message Types
### Chat Messages
```javascript
// Send a chat message
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
type: 'message',
content: 'Hello, everyone!',
room: 'general',
nickname: 'John'
}));
// Receive chat message
{
"type": "message",
"content": "Hello, everyone!",
"room": "general",
"nickname": "John"
}
```
### System Messages
```javascript
// System notifications (received only)
{
"type": "system",
"content": "John joined the room",
"room": "general",
"nickname": "System"
}
// User list updates
{
"type": "users_update",
"content": ["John", "Jane", "Bob"],
"room": "general"
}
```
### Collaborative Features
```javascript
// Drawing data
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
type: 'draw',
content: {
fromX: 100, fromY: 150,
toX: 200, toY: 250,
color: '#FF0000'
}
}));
// Cursor movement
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
type: 'cursor_move',
content: { x: 150, y: 200 }
}));
// Code updates
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
type: 'code_update',
content: {
code: 'console.log("Hello World");',
language: 'javascript'
}
}));
```
## Live Examples
Base Framework includes several built-in WebSocket examples that you can access when running your server. These examples demonstrate different real-time features and can be used as templates for your own applications.

Access Examples
When your Base Framework server is running, visit `http://localhost:8100/static/` to see all available examples. Each example includes full source code you can adapt for your needs.
## Integration with Base Framework
### Configuration
WebSocket support can be enabled or disabled using the `WS_ENABLED` environment variable. By default, WebSocket is enabled.
```bash
# Enable WebSocket support (default)
WS_ENABLED=true
# Disable WebSocket support
WS_ENABLED=false
```
Conditional Initialization
When `WS_ENABLED=false`, the WebSocket hub is not initialized and the `/api/ws` endpoint is not registered, reducing memory usage and startup time.
### Automatic Initialization
When WebSocket is enabled, it's automatically initialized during application startup. The WebSocket hub starts automatically and registers the `/api/ws` endpoint.
### Broadcasting from Controllers
```go
// Access WebSocket hub in your controllers
func (c *YourController) BroadcastUpdate(ctx *router.Context) error {
// Get the WebSocket hub (this would need to be injected)
// hub.BroadcastMessage("update", map[string]any{
//     "type": "data_update",
//     "payload": yourData,
// })
return ctx.JSON(200, map[string]any{"status": "broadcasted"})
}
```
### Event Integration
WebSocket integrates seamlessly with Base Framework's event system. You can listen for model changes and automatically broadcast updates to connected clients.
## Security & Best Practices
CORS Configuration
The WebSocket upgrader currently allows all origins for development. In production, configure the CheckOrigin function to validate allowed origins.
### Authentication
WebSocket connections can be authenticated using query parameters, headers, or by validating tokens during the connection upgrade process.
### Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting for WebSocket messages to prevent spam and abuse. Consider limiting messages per user per second.
### Message Validation
Always validate incoming WebSocket messages on the server side. Never trust client-provided data without proper validation and sanitization.
## Architecture
### Hub Pattern
Base Framework uses a centralized hub pattern for WebSocket management. The hub maintains all active connections, handles room management, and coordinates message broadcasting between clients.
### Connection Lifecycle
- **Connect:** Client upgrades HTTP connection to WebSocket
- **Register:** Client is added to the hub and assigned to a room
- **Message Handling:** Incoming messages are processed and broadcast
- **Disconnect:** Client is removed from hub and room notifications sent
### Scalability
For high-scale applications, consider using Redis or other message brokers to enable WebSocket clustering across multiple server instances.
