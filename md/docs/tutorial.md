# Blog Tutorial
Build a complete blog application from scratch and learn Base Framework fundamentals.
## Step 1: Create Your Blog Project
Let's start by creating a new Base Framework project for our blog API:
Terminal
```
base new blog
cd blog
```
#### You'll get initial structure:
```
blog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.go # Module registration
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models/ # Your database models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ # Core modules
```
## Step 2: Understanding Core Modules
Base Framework comes with built-in core modules that provide essential functionality. Let's explore what's
available
in our blog project:
##### üë§ Authentication Module
- ‚Ä¢ User model with auth features
- ‚Ä¢ Login, register, forgot password, reset password, logout endpoints
- ‚Ä¢ Located at core/app/authentication/
##### üë§ Authorization Module
- ‚Ä¢ Role model with auth features
- ‚Ä¢ Permission model with auth features
- ‚Ä¢ Located at core/app/authorization/
##### üë§ Profile Module
- ‚Ä¢ User model with auth features
- ‚Ä¢ Profile management endpoints
- ‚Ä¢ Avatar upload support
- ‚Ä¢ Located at core/app/profile/
##### üìÅ Media Module
- ‚Ä¢ File and image management
- ‚Ä¢ Upload validation
- ‚Ä¢ Storage integration
- ‚Ä¢ Located at core/app/media/
## Step 3: Generate Post Module with
Relationships
Now let's generate our blog post module with relationships to the built-in core modules using
belongsTo:profile.User and belongsTo:media.Media:
Terminal
```
`
base g Post \
title:string \
content:text \
slug:string \
published:bool \
author:belongsTo:profile.User \
featured_image:belongsTo:media.Media
`
```
#### Generated Output:
```
Generated app/models/post.go
Generated app/posts/service.go
Generated app/posts/controller.go
Generated app/posts/module.go
Generated app/posts/validator.go
‚úÖ Added module to app/init.go
‚úÖ Dependencies updated
Successfully generated Post module
```
#### What Was Created:
##### üìÑ Model (app/models/post.go)
- ‚Ä¢ Post struct with GORM tags
- ‚Ä¢ CreatePostRequest & UpdatePostRequest
- ‚Ä¢ PostResponse & PostListResponse
- ‚Ä¢ ToResponse() conversion methods
##### üéÆ Controller (app/posts/controller.go)
- ‚Ä¢ GET /posts (paginated list)
- ‚Ä¢ POST /posts (create)
- ‚Ä¢ GET /posts/:id (get by ID)
- ‚Ä¢ PUT /posts/:id (update)
- ‚Ä¢ DELETE /posts/:id (delete)
##### ‚öôÔ∏è Service (app/posts/service.go)
- ‚Ä¢ Business logic layer
- ‚Ä¢ Database operations
- ‚Ä¢ Data validation
- ‚Ä¢ Error handling
##### üîß Module Registration
- ‚Ä¢ Auto-registered in app/init.go
- ‚Ä¢ Dependency injection setup
- ‚Ä¢ Route registration
- ‚Ä¢ Database migrations
## Step 4: Start Your Blog API Server
Let's start the server with Swagger documentation enabled to see our API in action:
Terminal
```
base start -d
```
#### Server Output:
```
`
üìö Generating swagger documentation...
üìã Found 40 endpoints across 7 controller files
üöÄ Starting Base Framework
‚úÖ Database initialized
‚úÖ Infrastructure initialized
‚úÖ Router initialized
‚úÖ Module initialization complete
üéâ Base Framework Ready!
üìç Server URLs:
- Local: http://localhost:8100
- Network: http://192.168.1.35:8100
üìö Documentation:
- Swagger: http://localhost:8100/swagger/index.html
`
```
## Step 5: Test Your Blog API
Your blog API is now ready! Here are the automatically generated endpoints:
POST
/api/posts
Create a new blog post
GET
/api/posts
Get paginated list of posts
GET
/api/posts/all
Get all posts (unpaginated)
GET
/api/posts/:id
Get specific post by ID
PUT
/api/posts/:id
Update existing post
DELETE
/api/posts/:id
Delete post
#### Try It Out - Create Your First User and
Post
First, create a user
```
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8100/api/auth/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"first_name": "John",
"last_name": "Doe",
"email": "john@example.com",
"password": "password"
}'
```
Then, create a post with the user relationship
```
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8100/api/posts \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"title": "My First Blog Post",
"content": "My first blog post with Base Framework!",
"slug": "my-first-blog-post",
"published": true,
"author_id": 1
}'
```
## Step 6: Explore What You Built
Interactive API Documentation
Visit http://localhost:8100/swagger/ to explore your API interactively.
- ‚Ä¢ Try all endpoints directly in the browser
- ‚Ä¢ See request/response schemas
- ‚Ä¢ Generate client code
Database Ready
Your database is automatically configured with:
- ‚Ä¢ Auto-migrations for Post model
- ‚Ä¢ GORM relationships
- ‚Ä¢ Optimized indexes
#### What's Next?
##### Complete Blog Example
See the complete implementation below with all
relationships
##### Add Authentication
Enable built-in authentication with JWT tokens
##### Add File Uploads
Use field types like image:image or
attachment:file
for media
## Complete Blog Implementation
Let's build a comprehensive blog system showcasing Base Framework's full capabilities including file
uploads,
relationships, various field types, and event system:
Full-Featured Blog Generation
##### 1. Generate Category Module
Terminal
```
`
base g Category \
name:string \
description:text \
slug:string \
color:string
`
```
Creates Category for organizing posts (one-to-many)
##### 2. Generate Tag Module
Terminal
```
`
base g Tag \
name:string \
slug:string \
color:string \
description:text
`
```
Creates Tag system for labeling posts (many-to-many)
##### 3. Generate Comprehensive Post Module
Terminal
```
`
base g Post \
title:string \
content:text \
