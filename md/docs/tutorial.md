# Blog Tutorial

Build a complete blog application from scratch and learn Base Framework fundamentals.

## Step 1: Create Your Blog Project

Let's start by creating a new Base Framework project for our blog API:

```bash
base new blog
cd blog
```

### Initial Project Structure

```
blog/
├── app/
│   ├── init.go     # Module registration
│   └── models/     # Your database models
└── core/           # Core modules
```

## Step 2: Understanding Core Modules

Base Framework comes with built-in core modules that provide essential functionality. Let's explore what's available in our blog project:

### Authentication Module

- User model with auth features
- Login, register, forgot password, reset password, logout endpoints
- Located at core/app/authentication/

### Authorization Module

- Role model with auth features
- Permission model with auth features
- Located at core/app/authorization/

### Profile Module

- User model with auth features
- Profile management endpoints
- Avatar upload support
- Located at core/app/profile/

### Media Module

- File and image management
- Upload validation
- Storage integration
- Located at core/app/media/

## Step 3: Generate Post Module with Relationships

Now let's generate our blog post module with relationships to the built-in core modules using belongsTo:profile.User and belongsTo:media.Media:

```bash
base g Post \
  title:string \
  content:text \
  slug:string \
  published:bool \
  author:belongsTo:profile.User \
  featured_image:belongsTo:media.Media
```

### Generated Output

```
Generated app/models/post.go
Generated app/posts/service.go
Generated app/posts/controller.go
Generated app/posts/module.go
Generated app/posts/validator.go
✅ Added module to app/init.go
✅ Dependencies updated
Successfully generated Post module
```

### What Was Created

#### Model (app/models/post.go)

- Post struct with GORM tags
- CreatePostRequest & UpdatePostRequest
- PostResponse & PostListResponse
- ToResponse() conversion methods

#### Controller (app/posts/controller.go)

- GET /posts (paginated list)
- POST /posts (create)
- GET /posts/:id (get by ID)
- PUT /posts/:id (update)
- DELETE /posts/:id (delete)

#### Service (app/posts/service.go)

- Business logic layer
- Database operations
- Data validation
- Error handling

#### Module Registration

- Auto-registered in app/init.go
- Dependency injection setup
- Route registration
- Database migrations

## Step 4: Start Your Blog API Server

Let's start the server with Swagger documentation enabled to see our API in action:

```bash
base start -d
```

### Server Output

```
Generating swagger documentation...
Found 40 endpoints across 7 controller files
Starting Base Framework
✅ Database initialized
✅ Infrastructure initialized
✅ Router initialized
✅ Module initialization complete
Base Framework Ready!

Server URLs:
- Local: http://localhost:8100
- Network: http://192.168.1.35:8100

Documentation:
- Swagger: http://localhost:8100/swagger/index.html
```

## Step 5: Test Your Blog API

Your blog API is now ready! Here are the automatically generated endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/posts` | Create a new blog post |
| GET | `/api/posts` | Get paginated list of posts |
| GET | `/api/posts/all` | Get all posts (unpaginated) |
| GET | `/api/posts/:id` | Get specific post by ID |
| PUT | `/api/posts/:id` | Update existing post |
| DELETE | `/api/posts/:id` | Delete post |

### Try It Out - Create Your First User and Post

First, create a user:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8100/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }'
```

Then, create a post with the user relationship:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8100/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Blog Post",
    "content": "My first blog post with Base Framework!",
    "slug": "my-first-blog-post",
    "published": true,
    "author_id": 1
  }'
```

## Step 6: Explore What You Built

### Interactive API Documentation

Visit http://localhost:8100/swagger/ to explore your API interactively:

- Try all endpoints directly in the browser
- See request/response schemas
- Generate client code

### Database Ready

Your database is automatically configured with:

- Auto-migrations for Post model
- GORM relationships
- Optimized indexes

### What's Next?

#### Complete Blog Example

See the complete implementation below with all relationships

#### Add Authentication

Enable built-in authentication with JWT tokens

#### Add File Uploads

Use field types like image:image or attachment:file for media

## Complete Blog Implementation

Let's build a comprehensive blog system showcasing Base Framework's full capabilities including file uploads, relationships, various field types, and event system:

### 1. Generate Category Module

```bash
base g Category \
  name:string \
  description:text \
  slug:string \
  color:string
```

Creates Category for organizing posts (one-to-many)

### 2. Generate Tag Module

```bash
base g Tag \
  name:string \
  slug:string \
  color:string \
  description:text
```

Creates Tag system for labeling posts (many-to-many)

### 3. Generate Comprehensive Post Module

```bash
base g Post \
  title:string \
  content:text \
  slug:string \
  excerpt:text \
  published:bool \
  featured_image:image \
  gallery:attachment \
  author:belongsTo:profile.User \
  category:belongsTo:Category \
  tags:toMany:Tag \
  publish_date:datetime \
  view_count:int
```

**Demonstrates multiple relationship types:** belongsTo core modules, belongsTo custom modules, plus all field types

### 4. Generate Advanced Comment System

```bash
base g Comment \
  content:text \
  post:belongsTo:Post \
  author:belongsTo:profile.User \
  parent_comment:belongsTo:Comment \
  reply_to_email:email \
  approved:bool \
  ip_address:string \
  user_agent:text
```

**Advanced features:** nested comments, email validation, moderation, tracking fields

### 5. Start with Full Documentation

```bash
base s -d
```

Includes automatic file upload endpoints, validation, and Swagger docs

### Field Types Demonstrated

#### Basic Types

- **string** - Short text fields
- **text** - Long text content
- **bool** - True/false values
- **int** - Numeric values
- **datetime** - Date and time

#### Advanced Types

- **email** - Email validation
- **image** - Image uploads
- **attachment** - File uploads
- **belongsTo** - Relationships

### Generated API Endpoints (40+ endpoints)

#### Categories API
- CRUD `/api/categories`

#### Tags API
- CRUD `/api/tags`

#### Posts API + File Uploads
- CRUD `/api/posts/*`
- POST `/api/posts/:id/featured_image`
- DELETE `/api/posts/:id/featured_image`

#### Comments + Core
- CRUD `/api/comments/*`
- GET `/api/profile/*`
- POST `/api/auth/*`

**Automatic Features:** 50+ endpoints with pagination, sorting, filtering, validation, file upload endpoints, relationship preloading, Swagger docs, and event emission!

### File Upload Examples

#### Upload Featured Image to Post

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/posts/1/featured_image \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@hero-image.jpg"
```

Automatic validation, resizing, storage, and database association

#### Create Post with Rich Content

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Advanced Blog Post",
    "content": "Full HTML content...",
    "excerpt": "Post summary",
    "slug": "advanced-blog-post",
    "published": true,
    "tags": "tech,base-framework,tutorial",
    "publish_date": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
    "view_count": 0,
    "author_id": 1,
    "category_id": 1
